🚀 Hackathon Project - Norges Gruppen x STAR

🥉 Proudly achieved 3rd Place!

This repository contains our innovative AI-powered solutions developed during a 16-hour hackathon hosted by Norges Gruppen and STAR. Our challenge was to improve the grocery shopping experience through advanced computer vision techniques.

📌 Challenges & Solutions

🥦 Product Recognition

Objective: Develop a model that accurately classifies grocery products from images.

Solution: Implemented YOLOv11 for fast, real-time object detection and classification across 26 product categories.

📹 Video Receipt Generation and Theft Detection

Objective: Analyze self-checkout video to generate receipts and detect theft in real-time.

Solution: Created a video analysis system capable of:

Tracking products frame-by-frame.

Counting multiple instances of products.

Generating accurate receipts matched against real transactions.

Detecting unscanned products to identify potential theft.

🌐 Bonus: Real-Time Food Detector Website

Deployed a live web demo showcasing real-time food detection.

Interactive user experience powered by our YOLOv11 model.
